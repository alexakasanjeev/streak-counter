# Streaky

Streaky was born from streak counting mechanism of [Duolingo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en_IN) app, which motivated me to keep learning Spanish. Gracias Duolingo. Streaky is a streak counter app, to help track your habits/task by maintaining streak, it's also ad-free and open source under GNUv3 license.
